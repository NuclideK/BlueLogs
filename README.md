# BlueLogs
Usage: Put the jar in the plugins folder of a spigot Minecraft server


This is a small project I made because it was needed, but after some feedback I received I thought maybe others could find this useful, so here we are.

Any feedback / feature requests are much appreciated! Just make an issue or pull request


Special thanks to k3kdude for saving me from alot of pain with the webhook (https://gist.github.com/k3kdude/fba6f6b37594eae3d6f9475330733bdb)
